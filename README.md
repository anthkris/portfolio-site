# K. Anthony Portfolio Site

This site was ported over from WordPress and is build on Gatsby JS.

The base design was taken from the MIT licensed portfolio of James Ciclitira: https://github.com/james-ciclitira/portfolio-site

## New Functionality

While the main page design was taken from James, I've added a couple of other pieces of functionality.

- Full-text blog post search
- Paginated blog home
- Blog posts
- Larger body font size
- Skip navigation link and other accessibility fixes
