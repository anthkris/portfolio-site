This episode, I am talking with JR Dingwall, a higher ed instructional design consultant who I first met through Jennifer Maddrell and Designers 4 Learning. I chatted with JR over email and I’m super excited to have him on the show because he has a really important story that I want to make sure we cover this season. JR went freelance for a while, and then decided that it wasn’t for him. As someone who is sort of always on the crossroads of this, I’m really interested in how this worked for him!

As always, shownotes are here: [https://simplecast.com/s/4fc4eb64](https://simplecast.com/s/4fc4eb64)

Be sure to reach out to JR (http://twitter.com/JRDingwall) to show him some love for sharing his journey into and out of freelancing with us!
