This episode, I am talking with Devlin Peck, a recent instructional design graduate student who jumped into freelancing with both feet while still a student. This episode is particularly exciting for me because Devlin had reached out to me previously as he was looking to break into ID and it’s amazing to see how far he’s come and what I can learn from his approach to his instructional design and elearning development business.

As always, shownotes are here: [https://simplecast.com/s/2513ae6e](https://simplecast.com/s/2513ae6e)
