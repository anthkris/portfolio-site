This episode, I’m with Wes Atkinson, Co-founder and Lead Technical Consultant at Appitierre Ltd, the makers of the Evolve Authoring tool and the Bloom LMS. And we are going to keep on theme about the freelancer journey but with a bit of a twist, from the perspective of a vendor. Which is super awesome! Vendors get a lot of our flack when we talk or complain and they’re at all of these conferences and events, so they talk to a lot of IDs, and so I’m really excited to be hearing things from this perspective.

As always, shownotes are here: [https://simplecast.com/s/7c3c8a1c](https://simplecast.com/s/f68d7580)
