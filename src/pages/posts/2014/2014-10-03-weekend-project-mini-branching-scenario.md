Though I don't often get a chance to use Articulate Storyline (hoping to change that soon!) I keep up with their community blogs and I like to see what I can do with their challenges. One of the older challenges was to create a branching scenario. I chose [Adam Bluestein's What Kind of Leader are You flowchart on Inc.com](http://www.inc.com/magazine/201310/adam-bluestein/what-kind-of-leader-are-you.html "What Kind of Leader are You?")

Though simple, the project was instructive. I chose to have the decision automatically take the user to the next page but you could add a submit button of some kind, though the way I did it forces the user to make a choice without being able to vacillate. Mostly, it showed that creating branches can be accomplished with relative ease in Lectora. [Check the demo here.](/showcase/leadership/index.html "What Kind of Leader are You? (Interactive)")
