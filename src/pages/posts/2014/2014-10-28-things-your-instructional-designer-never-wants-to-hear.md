This week's challenge was meant to be fun and light but leave it to yours truly to make it heavy. I really wanted to try out my new CSS animation skills with this one. On, the whole, it works okay but there's probably more that can be done, particularly with aesthetics. One of the biggest issues was trying to make it work in Firefox. In hindsight, I used the Animation Cheat Sheet, but I probably should have used Animate.css for more cross-browser compatibility. Anyway, if you have Chrome, I suggest you use it for this one! (It works okay in Firefox) And whatever you do, don't use Internet Explorer!
