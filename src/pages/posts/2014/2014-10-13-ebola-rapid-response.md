The current Ebola outbreak has seen the spread of a lot of misinformation and worry. This week's Articulate Elearning Heroes Challenge was to create a quick Ebola awareness and information course. I love this idea because it illustrates how instructional designers can remain relevant by responding rapidly to widespread concern and misinformation with materials that set the record straight. I knew immediately I wanted that Keep Calm propaganda feel along with a dark, stark palette. The slender man also makes an appearance in the second slide. Don't look directly at him!
