This is my first time participating in the Articulate community's E-Learning Heroes Challenge. The Challenge this week: creating images for your courses with pictograms. Because of their simple lines and contrasting colors, pictograms are a great way to communicate ideas. Their design also makes them relatively easy to create. While they may not work for every situation, pictograms are a valid option if you have to create your own graphics. Though I've lurked for a while, I'm contemplating purchasing Storyline 2 and I wanted to get involved. I decided to keep things simple and create pictograms in my areas of expertise: warrior princesses and wizards. Check it out!
