I love to look at design inspiration outside of the eLearning box. From web design to flyers and posters to infographics, different design fields can have a lot to teach us. One of my favorite interactions to go back to is the [Enlightened Happy Hour interactive infographic by Column Five](http://www.columnfivemedia.com/work-items/interactive-the-enlightened-happy-hour-an-interactive-guide-to-what-youre-sipping "The Enlightened Happy Hour by Column Five"). (They fixed the site and the infographic is working again. YAY!!)

I love everything about the design of this piece but I was especially inspired by the video intro and the way they highlighted the drink from the background. I also liked that each drink got its own page of information yet all of the categories of drinks were easily accessible without having to return to the front page. I also just plain like the big beautiful images. One of the lessons learned from an interaction like this is in simplicity. It doesn't include step-by-step instructions on how to use it. It uses text sparingly and with great effect. Sometimes, I think in trying to reach a broad audience, we underestimate the user and cause ourselves great, big design headache by trying to fit 500 words of text on something that should be simple, clean, and beautiful.
