Honestly, I can say that I've never stressed out about any holiday. But then, I'm not one of those seemingly endless line of folks on HGTV worried about creating an entertaining space in my house. I don't entertain. That's just me. Still, I realize that "the holidays" can be very stressful for other people, so I wanted to share my particular zen-master chill with others.
