I declared [2015 my Year of the Project.](/blog/consistency-key-to-creativity/ "Consistency: Key to Creativity") So far, this has served me exceedingly well. Just about every week, I've either completed a small project or worked towards a larger project. It's been fun, informative, and it's helped me build my skills. I'm looking forward to continuing to improve the rest of the year.

But I've noticed that, perhaps especially when you enjoy the work, it's really really easy to edge ever closer towards burnout.
