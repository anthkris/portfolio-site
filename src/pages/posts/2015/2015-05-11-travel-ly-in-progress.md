I didn't spend nearly as long as I should have liked to on my GDS Challenge this week, between my volunteer project and other things. But I think I have a good feel for where it's going.

## Look and Feel

I'm channeling London Underground and subway maps in general for this challenge. Right now, my color palette is a little more neon than London's but I like how hip the bright colors feel.

## Menu

I was greatly inspired by [Tim Slade's Trivia Adventure](https://community.articulate.com/articles/navigation-menus-elearning) and the way he used a map as central navigation. I think that conceit will work well in this course.

## Challenges

I've mapped out (pun totally intended) 4 interactive challenges: locating top London attractions, identifying the best ways to get around London, noting where Travelly hosts are in London, and a final challenge of putting it all together. Allen Interactions' Expedia demo was a huge inspiration here. I want to make sure that the course focuses on practicing important skills and, at least in the later challenges, on intrinsic feedback.
