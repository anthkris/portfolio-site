Here's an idea I stole from [Doug Belshaw](http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/): end of the week notes. Especially as I value making stuff, so highly, it seems sensible to recap my making efforts every week, and get further insight into what I'm doing. So, here goes! This week, I've been:

*   **Writing and shipping** a new eBook: [Go Design Something](https://gumroad.com/l/eOwj). Intended for other instructional design newbies who want some practical steps to creating a great portfolio.
*   **Creating** [Issue 12 of the Go Design Something newsletter](http://us10.campaign-archive2.com/?u=42226c0254a17e043bbf7bcb2&id=e4bf430d48). It's been 3 months since my last issue! I redesigned it a bit to be more visual. I'd love some feedback on if it's useful to you. You can subscribe in the sidebar if you're interested.
*   **Planning** for a podcast. I've been listening to a lot of great podcasts lately. There aren't many instructional design-specific options out there. I was thinking either a interview style, like Code Newbies or a short monologue style. Maybe a mix of both would be best?
*   **Settling in** to a new job. I got a new job at the University of Texas! I'm super excited. There are a lot of interesting projects on the horizon and I'm already getting the chance to integrate some of my front-end development skills to [create an interactive data viz on student journeys](/blog/data-viz-experiments-with-google-charts/).
