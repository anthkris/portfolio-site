For this month's [AWSM Prompt](https://awsmprompts.wordpress.com/2015/03/09/march-prompt-create-some-game-based-learning/ "Create Some Game-Based Learning"), I am creating a game-based module, based on the really cool [EdHeads Design a Cell Phone game](http://www.edheads.org/activities/eng_cell/ "EdHeads: Design a Cell Phone"). I didn't realize that March had advanced so far! I hope I can finish it before the month is up. I hope to add an animation of the main avatar, Rae, using After Effects so that she can move her mouth and shuffle a bit. Enjoy this GIF while I continue designing. What are you designing this month?
