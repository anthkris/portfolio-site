I began the Daily UI 100 day challenge. Here's my Day 1 entry for a sign up page:

<figure>
  <img src="../../../../public/images/post-images/Sign-Up-Page.png" alt="Daily UI practice" />
  <figcaption>My attempt at a sign up form</figcaption>
</figure>

Seems a simple task but the sign up page should be very simple for people to use AND only collect the information absolutely necessary. Those are important elements to think about.
