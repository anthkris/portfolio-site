It's another Friday. This has been one of those weeks where I've felt like I should have done more. I tried to start working out again, but as much as I'm loving my new workplace in other ways, the gym isn't part of that. State of the art, mind you, but there's no zen there. So I don't want to go. I need to find an alternative... On a development note, this week, I:

*   **Finished** the Treehouse front end developer track. It's been a little over a year since I began. Awesome that I made it through!
*   **Began** my Free Code Camp front end projects. Excited to begin creating projects!
*   **Signed up** for Daily UI, a project of designing small UI projects for 100 days.
*   **Discovered**Â Briefbox, a collection of design briefs for newbie designers and others looking to strengthen their skills and beef up their portfolios. A perfect template for instructional designers willing to do the practice work. I'd like to see if I can recreate it. Perhaps at my GoDesignSomething.co site. Building from scratch. OR maybe not.
*   **Made** real progress with my data viz using Google Charts. It's been a struggle but I've had great help from Stack Overflow and the Google Charts community.
