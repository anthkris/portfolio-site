I didn't get much work done this weekend, but in the previous days, I went through several demos for game creation software in an effort to try and choose a platform for game-design in my GDS Challenge. In the end, I found that they all will need more of a time investment to get really good with but, for now at least, I'm going with Construct 2 because it allows me to take my development on the road. Here are a few demos:

## Phaser IO

The Phaser tutorial was really nice and I liked that they not only game you tutorial files but they showed you some other important game ideas like scoring. Development was fairly simple and output is HTML5.

## Stencyl

Stencyl development was a little more difficult but I really like the layout of the workspace and game files. It's really easy for me to find where everything is. Output (for an unpaid version at least) is a nicely compact flash file which makes it really easy to transport because you don't have to worry about losing anything.

## Construct 2

Construct 2 probably gave me the most trouble development-wise and I'm not a huge fan of the workspace and game files layout. However, the output is really nice-looking HTML5 that seems to be responsive to window size, which makes it a great option for embedding in Storyline. The best thing, though, is that the program can be installed on a portable drive, allowing me to take game development with me, instead of being tied to one computer. The tutorial files were a little less helpful than Stencyl or Phaser IO but I'm (very, very slowly) getting the hang of it. Still, I don't expect that my GDS Challenge will be anything remarkable.
