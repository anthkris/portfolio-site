In this teardown episode, I dive (punny, right!) into the interactive video/simulation, Sortie en Mer (A Trip out to Sea).

This is another one of my favorite interactive video-type interactions. It has a simulation game as a major part of the experience and I think you'll really enjoy taking a deeper look into why it works. This episode, I talk the original context of the interaction, taking a look at the video narrative setup and the game mechanics, and how this sort of thing might be integrated into a learning experience. As always, check out more shownotes on the show page:Â https://dearinstructionaldesigner.simplecast.fm/ And here's the video teardown!
