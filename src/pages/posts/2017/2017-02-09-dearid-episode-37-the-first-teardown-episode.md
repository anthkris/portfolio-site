This episode, I try something a little different! A detailed teardown of the interactive video, Will You Fit into Deloitte? In keeping with the theme of this season, taking a look at real projects out in the world, I'm doing a series of episodes where I take a deep dive into some interactions, videos, courses, and other learning objects to talk about what I think works, what maybe doesn't work so well, and ideas I think we can take to use in our own work.

As a part of these episodes, I'm also releasing a video version. You can check out the video teardown below:

Let me know what you think and if you'd like to hear more (or less) of these!
