If you are a ID newbie, or someone who wants to learn a new skill, your number one question is, how can I get experience? I will always recommend that you [start making stuff.](/blog/seriously-though-the-answer-is-make-stuff/) But where do you get ideas? I have a lot of thoughts on this, [my latest one is about civic learning](/blog/civic-learning-an-idea-generated-from-torrance-learnings-download-un-conference/), but our last episode with Simon Date, we talk about open source, the philosophy behind it, and why IDs might want to jump in.
