This episode, I’ve got a real treat: a cutting edge tech project from my friend, David Fusco! David’s interested in emerging technologies like the voice controlled tech in Amazon’s Echo or Google’s Home devices. He’s created a voice activated quiz using Amazon’s Alexa technology and is generating xAPI statements from it. I wanted to talk to him about the whys and hows of working on a cutting-edge project like this.
