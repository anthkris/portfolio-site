We're back again with Simon Date this episode, discussing the whys and wherefores of using Adapt in a real elearning shop!

If you've been iffy on the benefits or the evidence of the Adapt Learning tool in real environments, this episode is for you! This one (and the next one!) is one of my favorite episodes with Simon! He brings to light so many great points about why you might want to use Adapt, how they use it at his organization, and we talk realistically about some of the possible drawbacks. I'm sure you'll enjoy this episode as much as I do! As always, check out the shownotes on the show page: [https://dearinstructionaldesigner.simplecast.fm/](https://dearinstructionaldesigner.simplecast.fm/) And don't forget to [leave a rating and review for us on iTunes](itms://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dear-instructional-designer/id1111995456?mt=2).
