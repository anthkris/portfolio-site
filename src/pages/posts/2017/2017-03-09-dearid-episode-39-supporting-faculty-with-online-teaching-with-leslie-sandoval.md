This episode, I sit down with Leslie Sandoval, instructional designer of 11 years, and we talk higher ed and a project supporting faculty with online courses. We’re digging into what is probably a universal issue for higher ed IDs: supporting faculty in the pedagogy and technology necessary to teach online courses and the online portions of hybrid courses. Leslie shares the ups and downs, ins and outs of implementing their first wave solution to tackle this need.
