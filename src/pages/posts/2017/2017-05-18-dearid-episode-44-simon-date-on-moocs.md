The first of three (I say four in audio) episodes with Simon Date, Adapt developer extraordinaire!

Simon took me up on my ridiculous pitch at the end of Season 2 to have an extended conversation. Simon and I will be talking all things open and the intersection between development and instructional design and open source. In this episodes, we're talking about MOOCs at King's College, London!
