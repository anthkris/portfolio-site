This episode, I sit down with our "newbiest" ID yet, Ellen Hayes, and we talk about her process building an online course for a student maker space. Ellen shares her interesting journey towards ID, and how she combined code and software development processes (namely Agile) to go out and study her users and the space, iterate, and build a solution to an understaffing situation.
