This episode, I talk with Zsolt Olah, one of my ID heroes, about two different projects that illustrate how context is king. Zsolt shares how, in two separate situations, the thing that he was asked for, a course, turned out to not be the thing that was needed. He discusses his design process and how we, as newbies, can learn to ask the right questions about context that will guide our clients to the real problem and more effective solutions.
