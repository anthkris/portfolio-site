Today’s interview is with Rachel Barnum, a really awesome instructional designer who I’ve followed on Twitter for some time now. Interested in ID roles that focus on face-to-face workshops? This one's for you! Rachel shares how she transitioned from more development-focused roles to a role that is currently more focused on face-to-face experiences. She shares how she wrangles projects with 5 SMEs (5 SMEs!) as opposed to 1 or 2 and what a portfolio for someone in this type of ID role might look like.
