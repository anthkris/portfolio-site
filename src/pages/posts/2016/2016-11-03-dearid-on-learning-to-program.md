This episode, I talk about my coding journey and how coding helps us to solve more problems as learning experience designers. You  may be evaluating whether or not learning to code is a worthwhile endeavor. I show how coding has helped me to expand my solution options, as well as why coding may not be for everyone.

I really want to hear what you guys think of this episode. I've heard from several IDs who are learning to code or wanting advice about whether they should learn to code. What would you say to them?
