When I say game makers, I mean tools that democratize making (mostly 2D) games. This broad category of tools can be less expensive, more versatile, and still allow offer you the same experience in creating effective learning experiences. With the recent announcement about Articulate 360, while exciting, I got to thinking that this episode may be even more relevant for other ID newbies who may feel priced out of that new platform. Like the last episode, this is a great episode for people looking for an alternative way to get starting creating interactive learning experiences.
