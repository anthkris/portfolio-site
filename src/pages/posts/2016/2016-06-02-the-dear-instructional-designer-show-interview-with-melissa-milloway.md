In this episode, I interview the fabulous, versatile, and prolific Mel Milloway. Mel talks to us about development work and her methods for practicing and trying new things. If you've got some time, be sure to reach out to Mel on Twitter ([@MelMilloway](https://twitter.com/MelMilloway)) to show her some love for sharing her expertise! Here's the interview. Remember, [shownotes are available on the show page](https://dearinstructionaldesigner.simplecast.fm/episodes/37281-episode-8-interview-with-mel-milloway).
