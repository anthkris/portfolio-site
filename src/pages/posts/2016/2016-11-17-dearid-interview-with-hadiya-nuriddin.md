I was interested in having Hadiya on when I heard about her new venture FreshEye Reviews, where she’ll be focusing on simplifying the quality control process for organizations. In this episode, we talk about quality control vs. quality assurance and how we should implement these processes as a non-negotiable in our creation process. As always, get the shownotes are available on the show page: [https://dearinstructionaldesigner.simplecast.fm/](https://dearinstructionaldesigner.simplecast.fm/)
