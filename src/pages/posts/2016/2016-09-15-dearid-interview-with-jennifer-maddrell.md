I’m super excited to bring you my conversation with Jennifer Maddrell, the founder of the Designers for Learning, a non-profit dedicated to getting instructional designers hand-on practice through service learning. Listen in to learn more about this amazing opportunity to do real ID work. If you’re an instructional design student or otherwise accidental instructional designer as so many of us are, you’re likely asking yourself how you can gain experience. I often point to making your own challenges, but Designers for Learning is a way for you to learn while you design and solve real problems. I encourage all of you to check out the program and help promote it in whatever way you feel comfortable.
