Listen in on my conversation with Ido Abramovich, a technical trainer turned training business owner in Israel. Ido gives us insight into his growing training business, where he's made the move from full time employee to entrepreneur with a business partner and employees. Ido shares insight into the business model he's adopted, this idea of Training as a Service that he uses to help lessen the risk for clients, his development stack, and his general thoughts on what it takes to run and grow a business in a niche market.
