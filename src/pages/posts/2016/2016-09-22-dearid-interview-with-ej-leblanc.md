In this episode, I interview EJ LeBlanc, ID business owner, avid experimenter, and a real model for continuing learning as an instructional designer. We talk about the latest tool that EJ is adding to his toolkit, the Unity gaming engine. EJ talks about his choice of Unity as a tool worth learning and a little about the process he takes to learn it.
