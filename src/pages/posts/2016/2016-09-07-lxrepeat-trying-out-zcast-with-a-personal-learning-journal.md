Product Hunt, threw zCast ([https://zcast.co/](https://zcast.co/)) in my face this week, so I decided to give it a go as a way to record my own personal learning journal. As is always the way in tech, I screwed up. A listener chimed in that she couldn't hear anything and so I repeated myself. Once I ended the zCast, I found that I had in fact been recording, though I'm still not sure which mic was being used. Anywhoodle, enjoy! (I'm also going to use this as a way to stop myself from using so many verbal pauses and smacking noises!)
