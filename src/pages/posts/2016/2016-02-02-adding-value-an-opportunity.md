Another interesting opportunity has cropped up in my current test prep course design project: creating documentation for the course. The project manager for this course suggested using a wiki, which I thought was a great idea from the start, but after kicking it around with my awesome coworker, we're excited about porting some of the documentation we create for this specific project into documentation that we could use as a basis for learning experience design discussions for all of our projects. Currently, there is no structure or process for walking clients through how we design. I'm hoping that the flowcharts and thought points we begin to describe can be expanded upon generally and serve as an really good introductory resource for our entire group as we work with faculty. All that just to say, be encouraged where there are no systems or structures. You may have a chance to create them yourself!
