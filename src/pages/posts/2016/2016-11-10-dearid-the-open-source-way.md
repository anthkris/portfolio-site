Piggybacking on last week's episode on learning to program, I discuss how we might carry over some of the principles of open source software development as a part of our solution-building toolbox as learning experience designers. I've been contributing to an open source project myself for several months now and I've started a daily(ish) coding practice on game development and the further along I go into my coding and LX design journey, the more admiration I have for the principles of open source. Wouldn't it be great for other newbies if we could be more open with each other?

As always you can get the shownotes on the show page: [https://dearinstructionaldesigner.simplecast.fm/](https://dearinstructionaldesigner.simplecast.fm/) I'd love to know what you think. Do you use open source principles in your work?
