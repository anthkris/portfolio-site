Today, I’m talking with Ant Pugh, elearning business owner from across the pond. Ant shares the hows and whys of building a free email subscription learning course around creating great elearning for a business. Previous guest, Alyssa Gomez actually reached out to me, with rave reviews about Ant’s new free subscription learning course on getting the most out of elearning for a business. So I reached out to him and asked him to discuss how he’s building his successful elearning business and the hows and whys of building this free course.
