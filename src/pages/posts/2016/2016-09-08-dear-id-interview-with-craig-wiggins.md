Howdy folks. Season 2 of Dear Instructional Designer is here! It's a season dedicated to the tools, tech, and solutions we use all across the spectrum of learning experience design. For the season starter, I sit down with Craig Wiggins: xAPI advocate and instructional designer extraordinaire.

In this awesome, anchoring conversation for Season 2, Craig Wiggins, major xAPI advocate and all around great guy, talks with us about how we can get back to the real root of instructional design, crafting solutions to performance problems, and how the xAPI encourages us to break out of our perhaps subtle, unconscious coupling of instructional design with elearning. Listen in to learn more about what the xAPI is and how using it could affect the focus and the competencies you need in your work as an instructional designer. As always, you can get the full shownotes on the show page: [https://dearinstructionaldesigner.simplecast.fm/](https://dearinstructionaldesigner.simplecast.fm/) *Just a note: Craig has recently left ADL and is on to a new adventure! Get at Craig on Twitter and let him know how much you loved the episode! [https://twitter.com/oxala75](https://twitter.com/oxala75)
