This one is for all of you [Instructional Design subredditors](http://reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign) who are teachers looking to break into instructional design.  Listen in to get the scoop on an alternative journey from teacher to instructional designer. Today I sit down with Alyssa Gomez, teacher turned ID, who is currently at work within the professional development department within her school district. Alyssa offers some great insight on her journey and how other teachers looking to increase their reach can look within the district as a first step to breaking out and into ID.
