Season 2 of Dear ID is finally over! In this episode, I share some stats about my 2016 year of projects, takeways from Season 2's focus on tools and tech, and what's next for Season 3 of Dear ID. I'm sick (for the first time in forever!) but I wanted to get out this season review. Thank you so much for listening in! Season 2 has been awesome!

There's also been a little movement in the most-listened-to episodes, though Jane Bozarth is holding the number 1 spot.
