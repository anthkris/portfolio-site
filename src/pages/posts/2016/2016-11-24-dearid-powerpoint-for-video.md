In this episode, I respond to a listener request for more talk about creating effective, interesting animated video. I could have gone high-tech, but instead, I challenge you to think about using PowerPoint for effective animated video.

Serendipitously, this episode and the next one (stay tuned!) coincide with the release of Articulate 360\. If you're looking for alternative tools to make stuff, give PowerPoint for animated video a go! Do you have any unconventional video tips or any examples of creating interactive/branched video. I'd love to hear from you. Leave it in the comments! As always, you can get the show notes on the show page: [https://dearinstructionaldesigner.simplecast.fm/](https://dearinstructionaldesigner.simplecast.fm/)
