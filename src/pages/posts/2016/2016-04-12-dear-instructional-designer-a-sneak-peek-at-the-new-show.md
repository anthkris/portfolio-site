As a part of my 2016 projects, I started thinking again about making a podcast. It's been in my mind for a long, long time, but I've been too chicken to get started. And then, I decided to put some things I had been learning into action... I asked people if they would be into it. Simple, right? But it can be a difficult step. Still, I asked and I got a lot of positive feedback! So I decided to pursue it! I've got quite a few interviews and topical shows lined up. I'm incredibly excited about this new idea and I really hope to make it interactive! In that spirit, I wanted to put the very first episode out into the world (a month early!) and get some feedback. Here's the episode. Let me know what you think!
