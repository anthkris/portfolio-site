In this episode, I sit down with Joseph Suarez, a really awesome and excellent instructional veteran of 10 years, who I met on the instructional design subreddit. Joseph talks with us about how his toolset has enabled him to create some award-winning learning experiences and the importance of continuing to learn. Loved this conversation with Joseph! We touched on so many things important to a good development process. Joseph also has some amazing insights on developing your own skill set over time and keeping up with ever changing technologies.
