In this episode, I sit down with Cara North, instructional designer at a major state university. Cara talks to us about how she uses the LMS at her institution, paying attention to your technology needs, and finding the right tool for the job. Cara’s official title is program specialist and, in her current role, wears many hats"instructional designer, training facilitator, and, interestingly, LMS administrator.  Now most of you out there may have frequent contact with your organization’s learning management system, but, honestly, not all of us go very deep in the weeds. Cara shares with us how she’s using the LMS in her organization.
