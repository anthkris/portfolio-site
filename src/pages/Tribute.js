              <p className='fw3 mt4'>I first encountered Yma Sumac from a Google Doodle on her birthday. After falling down an internet rabbit-hole, I listened to several of her songs and I fell in love with her sound! I jumped at the chance to build a more modern tribute and information page for this incredible soprano as a part of my work towards the Free Code Camp Front End Certification.</p>
              <p>This site is built using jQuery and the Bootstrap framwork. I derived inspiration for the UI from the (former) website of musician Franky Rizardo.</p>
