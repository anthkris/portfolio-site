          I am fundamentally motivated to{' '}
          <span className="motivationHighlight">learn new things</span> and
          display that learning through projects,{' '}
          <span className="motivationHighlight">meet challenges</span> and make
          progress towards goals, and{' '}
          <span className="motivationHighlight">make an impact</span> on
          processes, people, and organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s how that motivation translates into the things I concentrate
          on:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Work you can Play:</strong> I focus on solving problems in the
          learning space. The way I do that is by focusing on creating
          story-focused, game-based l experiences that allow people to make
          choices and experience consequences in a safe space. I’m particularly
          interested in the tech space and in social issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Operational Excellence:</strong> I am deeply committed to
          operating with excellence. For me, that means a focus on
          accessibility, documentation, process, building solid foundations, and
          digging deep to understand the fundamentals of a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Intellectual Curiosity and Reflection:</strong> I love
          learning new things, particularly when I know that I will be able to
          apply that knowledge to a project or problem. I value the support and
          space to learn about new ideas, technologies, and techniques, display
          that knowledge, and share with others.
