              <p className='fw3 mt4'>I've been wanting to be at the intersection of coding in JavaScript and game development and learning experience design for a while. While I'm currently practicing game dev with Phaser JS and ES6, this Simone game, built for the Free Code Camp Front End Certification, was the first framework-less game I'd built on my own and I'm super proud of how it turned out.</p>
              <p>The game features a UI that mimics the physical game, the ability to retry if you mess up, or if you play on strict mode, you have to start all over!</p>
