            <p className='fw3 mt4'>The University of Texas STEM Center sought to diversify their income streams early in 2017 by creating a series of professional development courses for educators. Along with this, they also wanted a purpose-built web application to help them market and sell these learning experiences. From the very beginning of the project, I have worked with the team as the front-end developer and web designer. </p>
            <p className='fw3 mt4'>As the project has matured, I have worked to institute best practices and consistent coding practices for the front-end across team members and to document the front-end.</p>

            <p className='fw3 mt4'>I also brought considerable accessibility experience to the project, having been the accessibility team lead on the large open source project, Oppia. I began by performing a site-wide accessibility audit and identifying and documenting best practices to ensure the site was as accessible as possible.</p>
