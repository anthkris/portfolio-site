           <p className='fw3 mt4'>BAC or Consequences is a graded activity for the FIVS123 Introduction to Forensics course in development for Texas A&M University by TEEX. This activity combines all of the previous review into one activity that challenges students to calculate the BAC for an individual after choosing an alcoholic drink to be consumed and the number to be consumed. After BAC is calculated, the activity further promotes thought and synthesis by challenging students to determine whether or not the BAC they calculated would mean that the driver would be intoxicated.</p>

            <p className='fw3 mt4'>As I worked on the Introduction to Forensics course, I wanted to create a mood for the course that would play off of the sexiness and coolness of forensics in television and film, but without being too overwhelming and conflicting with the course content.</p>
            <p>I created this theme using CSS and a little basic PHP, based on the Arialist theme. The background image was designed using stock images and Photoshop.</p>

This activity was built using a scaffolding technique: students begin with a step-by-step guide through the equation, then try it out with extrinsic feedback, then completely on their own.</p>
