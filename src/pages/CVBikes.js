            <p className='fw3 mt4'>The Adapt Learning Framework caught my attention as soon as I heard about it. This open source, responsive framework works on the concept of modularity, uses contemporary design patterns, and is fully responsive. What got me excited primarily (besides itâ€™s being open source!) was here was an elearning authoring tool that actually generated good, well-formed code AND that you could touch and alter and work with in very deep ways. Unlike so many other authoring tool options, I can control every facet of my Adapt course. I was very eager to get my hands on it and create something.</p>
            <p className='fw3 mt4'>
            So, I made some time to install the framework version of the tool and created an employee onboarding course for a (fictional) bespoke bicycle company.</p>

            <div className='bg-accent' style={{width: '40px', height:'4px' }}> </div>
            <p className='fw3 mt4'>Inspired by the amazing work of the folks at Sponge UK, I also included a mini-game in Phaser JS to test employee knowledge. In order to get the game to act appropriately as a gate (something that would prevent the learner from moving on until completion), I developed a plugin for the framework that allowed the game to send a signal to the course to let it know when the user has finished the game.</p>
