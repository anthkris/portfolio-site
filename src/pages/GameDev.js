              <p className='fw3 mt4'>I continue to regularly work on my game development skills by building and releasing small games using both the Phaser JS framework and Construct 3.</p>
              <p className='fw3 mt4'>Construct 3 is a relatively low-cost tool for creating responsive, HTML5 2D games. The user interface boasts a relatively simple learning curve and amakes it easy for organizations to maintain the games afterward.</p>
              <p className='fw3 mt4'>Phaser JS, on the other hand, is a 2D HTML5 framework for JavaScript developers but it has the advantage of being a free and open source framework. This means that it interactives I create in it are super sustainable as any other developer can pick up the code to maintain it or make changes in the future, no product required.</p>
              <p className='fw3 mt4'>By focusing on regularly creating projects with these tools, I ensure that I can quickly and easily create game prototypes and polished games for clients outside. Game development tools are purpose built and perform better than elearning tools for creating effective game-like experiences.</p>
