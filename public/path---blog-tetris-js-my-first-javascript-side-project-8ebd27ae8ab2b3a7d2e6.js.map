The tutorial for this project did a wonderful job of reinforcing this and I think there’s great carryover to elearning development, as well. So, for example, instead of diving right into code, we started off with some high-level concepts:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">//Build a grid\\n//Create tetronimos\\n//Allow for manipulation\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>From there, you can begin to build the functionality that meets those concepts.

This is another concept that has really great carryover to elearning. This is pretty doable in Storyline and Lectora. It can be a hassle in Storyline if trying to test out JavaScript functionality. Still, it’s a really important concept to practice because it prevents building a large project and then trying to figure out what’s causing the bugs.

The refactoring process encourages you to look over what you’ve written, look for repeated code and, either abstract it into a reusable function or try and make it more efficient. It’s important that this comes after building and testing small pieces so that you don’t get caught up in trying to make things efficient to the detriment of actually getting things done, especially as a new developer who probably doesn’t know all the tips and tricks of the trade yet. That’s been really freeing for me, to realize that I should first try and complete a challenge using what I know before going back and seeing if I can make it better.
