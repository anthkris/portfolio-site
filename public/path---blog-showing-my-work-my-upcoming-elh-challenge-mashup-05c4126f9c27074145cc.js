Before that, I had decided to build up my brand as best I could with a brand new website and portfolio and trying to blog about my design experiences. I took screenshots of my best work (work-for-hire don’tcha know, so I couldn’t post any interactive modules) and I engaged more fully in the Articulate community by purchasing Storyline 2 and participating in the the challenges. But it wasn’t enough. Several times, the interviewer asked me if I had anything else for him to view. And this weighed on my mind a lot. I love the challenges because they are bite-sized and modular and allow you to tackle a specific challenge. But it seemed that they weren’t working as show pieces. I can understand that. They are design practice, the equivalent of correcting 10 lines of code. What he was really asking for was original, fully-displayable, interactive pieces that showed my particular approach to design. So I wracked my brain and settled on the idea of a mashup. I mean several of the ELH challenges can be interconnected. And by connecting them in the right way, I could begin to tell a story. I’ve been an aspiring writer for… ever but when I started thinking more visually and trying to practice my craft, I’ve been guilty of not making time for writing practice. So when my fantasy kingdom idea first surfaced, I became really excited about the idea to practice my writing through my instructional design. Long story long, I’m currently working on a longer eLearning piece for my portfolio that takes the ELH Challenge to another level. Low and behold, I starting using <a href="http://popplet.com/">Popplet</a>, a tool that I had previously only used to collect fiction ideas, to plan out my mashup of <a href="https://community.articulate.com/articles/elearning-challenges" title="ELearning Challenges">ELHChallenges #43 and 44</a>, along with some other cool stuff concerning tourism in the psuedo-medieval fantasy kingdom of Essia. Stay tuned. It’s gonna be awesome. Though I’ve used Popplet before in the past,  I’m just coming around to how useful a branching/storyboarding tool it is and I wanted to take some time out to articulate why its been an important tool, and I’m beginning to use it more and more as a way to collect my ideas for things other than pure writing.</p>\n<h2>Some of the Stuff I like Most About using Popplet</h2>\n<p>-First, I love that it’s available to me whenever I need it. I purchased the iOS app some time ago and since I always have my iPad with me, I can jot down ideas and post links and photos whenever I get some inspiration. -The ability to visually represent branching alongside referencing inspiration material in the form of links and photos (I’m looking at you, <a href="Vhttp://www.tim-slade.com/meet-the-team-e-learning-template--jul.-19,-2014.html#.VIif48nj-tLttp://" title="MEET THE TEAM E-LEARNING TEMPLATE">Tim Slade</a> and <a href="https://025424c758f35501ccb783f8824bd85e0bee8ded.googledrive.com/host/0B5y_QMyqV7ZvMUtjM25aS29qa1E/" title="Melissa&#x27;s Interactive Org Chart">Melissa Milloway</a>!) is priceless. -I know that some people might use Pinterest (and I luv Pinterest) but in this situation, I think Popplet provides a better solution. The ability mind-map and visually represent connections between pieces of content was what I needed. -I like to color-code my headings so that I can see at a glance what type of popplet I’m looking at (pink for headings, black for content, green for changes, red for questions, and blue for inspiration). -I like how easily I can create and break a connections between popplets.</p>\n<figure>\n  \n  <span class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper" style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 810px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">\n    <span class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image" style="padding-bottom: 73.046875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;">\n      <img class="gatsby-resp-image-image" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;" alt="Essia Tourism Board Popplet" title="" src="/static/unnamed-e2a81774d5aea1f97cd1d4d245ec1dfe-aabb5.jpg" srcset="/static/unnamed-e2a81774d5aea1f97cd1d4d245ec1dfe-2320f.jpg 203w,\n/static/unnamed-e2a81774d5aea1f97cd1d4d245ec1dfe-427c1.jpg 405w,\n/static/unnamed-e2a81774d5aea1f97cd1d4d245ec1dfe-aabb5.jpg 810w,\n/static/unnamed-e2a81774d5aea1f97cd1d4d245ec1dfe-da62f.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n</figure>',frontmatter:{date:"December 11, 2014",path:"/blog/showing-my-work-my-upcoming-elh-challenge-mashup",title:"Showing my Work: My upcoming ELH Challenge Mashup",tags:["mashup","planning","popplet","storyboarding"],categories:["elearning","Elearning Heroes Challenge","Showing my Work"],featured:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.768172888015717,src:"/static/logoColor-c92143fb3723fcd5f12c0d0502759756-81d39.png",srcSet:"/static/logoColor-c92143fb3723fcd5f12c0d0502759756-9a8d1.png 203w,\n/static/logoColor-c92143fb3723fcd5f12c0d0502759756-c53f9.png 405w,\n/static/logoColor-c92143fb3723fcd5f12c0d0502759756-81d39.png 810w,\n/static/logoColor-c92143fb3723fcd5f12c0d0502759756-e81a9.png 900w",sizes:"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"}}}}}},pathContext:{}}}});
