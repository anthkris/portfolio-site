Conferences are great at helping you to build or solidify a community of people in your corner of the world or in your neck of the elearning industry.

By all means, go to the conference, you lucky so-and-sos, but don’t kid yourselves: nothing you learn there will help you get better at your job if you don’t, you know, actually do it and do it consistently. While some of the tips, for project management or SME communications, say, may be something that you practice on the job, many of the technical skill sessions that are so popular (graphic design trends, how to make your own graphics in PowerPoint, how to use x authoring tool, even rapid prototyping) those are not one and done types of things. They aren’t even 10 and done. That’s the kind of thing you practice over and over, again and again, until it becomes second nature (kind of like I’m doing with JavaScript algorithms right now, damn them). You can kid yourself into thinking that going to the conference will inspire you and you’ll be able to create all kinds of awesome things after that, but don’t be disappointed if three months, six months, a year from then, you’re courses haven’t changed a bit. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, creativity and inspiration are a function of practice (creativity_inspiration function(practice){}).</p>\\n<h2>The Other Thing About Conferences</h2>\\n<p>I watched an amazing TED talk last week (embedded below) which illustrates something that maybe our conferences (maybe most conferences?) sometimes don’t give you, and that’s dissenting opinions.</p>\\n<p><div>\\n          <div\\n            class=\\\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\\\"\\n            style=\\\"padding-bottom: 56.49999999999999%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\\\"\\n          >\\n            <iframe src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PY_kd46RfVE?rel=0\\\" class=\\\"embedVideoIframe\\\" allowfullscreen style=\\\"\\n            position: absolute;\\n            top: 0;\\n            left: 0;\\n            width: 100%;\\n            height: 100%;\\n          \\\"></iframe>\\n      <style>\\n        .embedVideoIframe {\\n          border: 0\\n        }\\n      </style>\\n          </div>\\n          </div></p>\\n<p>Sure, a lot of what we do is not reinventing the wheel.
