From web design to flyers and posters to infographics, different design fields can have a lot to teach us. One of my favorite interactions to go back to is the <a href="http://www.columnfivemedia.com/work-items/interactive-the-enlightened-happy-hour-an-interactive-guide-to-what-youre-sipping" title="The Enlightened Happy Hour by Column Five">Enlightened Happy Hour interactive infographic by Column Five</a>. (They fixed the site and the infographic is working again. YAY!!)</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src="../../post-imagesTheEnlightenedHappyHour_50a16e009dd48_w1500.JPG" alt="The Enlightened Happy Hour Infographic" />\n</figure>\n<p>I love everything about the design of this piece but I was especially inspired by the video intro and the way they highlighted the drink from the background. I also liked that each drink got its own page of information yet all of the categories of drinks were easily accessible without having to return to the front page. I also just plain like the big beautiful images. One of the lessons learned from an interaction like this is in simplicity. It doesnâ€™t include step-by-step instructions on how to use it. It uses text sparingly and with great effect. Sometimes, I think in trying to reach a broad audience, we underestimate the user and cause ourselves great, big design headache by trying to fit 500 words of text on something that should be simple, clean, and beautiful.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"September 19, 2014",path:"/blog/interaction-inspiration/",title:"Interaction Inspiration: Enlightened Happy Hour",tags:["infographic","inspiration","interactions"],categories:["elearning"],featured:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.5608740894901145,src:"/static/TheEnlightenedHappyHour-b619d225f3c8abd73c94d126f5b9bb01-c6512.jpg",srcSet:"/static/TheEnlightenedHappyHour-b619d225f3c8abd73c94d126f5b9bb01-c7d05.jpg 203w,\n/static/TheEnlightenedHappyHour-b619d225f3c8abd73c94d126f5b9bb01-784f5.jpg 405w,\n/static/TheEnlightenedHappyHour-b619d225f3c8abd73c94d126f5b9bb01-c6512.jpg 810w,\n/static/TheEnlightenedHappyHour-b619d225f3c8abd73c94d126f5b9bb01-adada.jpg 1215w,\n/static/TheEnlightenedHappyHour-b619d225f3c8abd73c94d126f5b9bb01-1c372.jpg 1500w",sizes:"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"}}}}}},pathContext:{}}}});
