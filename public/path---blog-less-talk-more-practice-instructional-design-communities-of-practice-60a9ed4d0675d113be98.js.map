A good web designer doesn’t just read up on the latest web design trends or best practices. He or she finds sites to design or redesign, just for themselves, just for the practice, in order to experiment with new concepts and technologies. And what do we do? How many of us actively practice designing instruction? Now I can almost hear you saying, “Kristin, I practice all the time. You know, at work.” But ask yourself, what creative practices or (only practices) while doing the job? Dancers don’t practice dancing during the performance; that’s what the weeks and months in between are for. What kind of performance do you think you’d get if the only time a dancer danced was at the show? Spoiler alert: a bad one. Now, writers might <em>seem</em> like notable exception to this whole practicing thing. They could be thought of as practicing as they write a novel, for example; they may still be experimenting, finding their voice. But if you think that that’s the only time they practice, you’d be flat out, dead, and in all other ways, wrong. They are always practicing: writing short stories, writing for prompts, writing essays. It should be the same with instructional designers. We need the practice. Without it, we aren’t living up to our potential. It’s too easy to settle into the comfort of old design templates and cluttered, glorified slideshows because of budgets and time constraints and all of the other things that happen in a project you’re being paid for. Practice is meant to get you ready for these challenges, to prime your creativity pump, to make you better at important work you do.</p>\\n<h2>Some Suggestions</h2>\\n<p>Maybe you’ve thought about practicing but you weren’t sure how to get started. It can sometimes be challenging to think up prompts and scenarios for yourself. So here’s the part where I point you in the right direction.
