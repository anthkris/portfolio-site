The one thing that stuck to me was the idea that:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Engagement is having a problem to solve.</p>\\n<p>– Ray Jimenez</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So often when I hear about engagement, it’s in terms of gamification or prettier courses or game-based courses or something like that. I’m not against game-based learning or good visual design, but engagement doesn’t have to come from trying to make something fun. When I need to learn something new because I’ve got a problem to solve, whether or not I’m having fun, I’m super motivated and engaged. I know I love development work, but thinking about this in terms of how I can help to advocate for helping the learner solve problems that they actually come up against, no matter what the mode (thinking back to the learning journeys session) is really the key. So this was really powerful.</p>\\n<h2>Day 3</h2>\\n<p>Today was a half day. I spent the morning in Jason Bickle’s session around pragmatic instructional design. In his DECLARE method, I saw a lot of what I’ve done previously with clients by asking them to help me plan out, in spreadsheet form, the content for the course and the correct medium, and the necessary assets. This was really more of a form of project and asset management for efficiency, and it was interesting to hear about how Jason has used his method to make development work work better.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 810px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"stages of conflict journey\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-aabb5.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-2320f.jpg 203w,\\n/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-427c1.jpg 405w,\\n/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-aabb5.jpg 810w,\\n/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-f0fe6.jpg 1215w,\\n/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-c6859.jpg 1620w,\\n/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-648e9.jpg 2430w,\\n/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-0e50d.jpg 4032w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n    <figcaption>8 stages of the conflict journey</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>Then in Katie Stroud’s session, she overlayed the hero’s journey to thinking about how do we design around the conflict journey for change management for a user. I think really insightful steps were thinking about:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>3 Resistance:</strong> Are we trying to deploy training before learners have reached the stage of conflict where they recognize that there is a problem to solve? If so, we may be causing conflict.</li>\\n<li><strong>6 Moving into the Unknown:</strong> What is going to get in the way of learners being able to implement the changes and how do we design around that?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>My last presenter session was from Joseph Suarez (!!!) where he told stories about his experience as an instructional designer and extrapolated some important lessons learned. I’ve read quite a lot around UX (user experience) and Joe shared a really impactful story around how observing his learners with training he designed really blew a whole in his thinking about how he advocated for design. While companies will often prioritize UX in other areas, I think they don’t expect it from us, but those tools and methodologies are essential for the work that we do, as well. As I’ve said before, I think there’s a TON we can learn from that discipline.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 810px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"gap between web development and elearning development\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-aabb5.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-2320f.jpg 203w,\\n/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-427c1.jpg 405w,\\n/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-aabb5.jpg 810w,\\n/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-f0fe6.jpg 1215w,\\n/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-c6859.jpg 1620w,\\n/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-648e9.jpg 2430w,\\n/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-0e50d.jpg 4032w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n    <figcaption>The strangeness of elearning courses comes from not bridging the gap.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<h2>My Experience</h2>\\n<p>On the whole, my experience with Learning Dev Camp has been pretty good.

I’m not quite sure what I would do with that during design, but I’m intrigued about what that might mean.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<figure>\\n    \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 810px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"slide about history of comic book communcation\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/img_2235-2a6a3997bdb1f65eec810ea103780902-aabb5.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/img_2235-2a6a3997bdb1f65eec810ea103780902-2320f.jpg 203w,\\n/static/img_2235-2a6a3997bdb1f65eec810ea103780902-427c1.jpg 405w,\\n/static/img_2235-2a6a3997bdb1f65eec810ea103780902-aabb5.jpg 810w,\\n/static/img_2235-2a6a3997bdb1f65eec810ea103780902-f0fe6.jpg 1215w,\\n/static/img_2235-2a6a3997bdb1f65eec810ea103780902-c6859.jpg 1620w,\\n/static/img_2235-2a6a3997bdb1f65eec810ea103780902-648e9.jpg 2430w,\\n/static/img_2235-2a6a3997bdb1f65eec810ea103780902-0e50d.jpg 4032w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n    <figcaption>Comic book visual communication</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>My second session was also with Ray Jimenez and focused on deep diving with learners. The one thing that stuck to me was the idea that:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Engagement is having a problem to solve.</p>\\n<p>– Ray Jimenez</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So often when I hear about engagement, it’s in terms of gamification or prettier courses or game-based courses or something like that. I’m not against game-based learning or good visual design, but engagement doesn’t have to come from trying to make something fun. When I need to learn something new because I’ve got a problem to solve, whether or not I’m having fun, I’m super motivated and engaged. I know I love development work, but thinking about this in terms of how I can help to advocate for helping the learner solve problems that they actually come up against, no matter what the mode (thinking back to the learning journeys session) is really the key. So this was really powerful.</p>\\n<h2>Day 3</h2>\\n<p>Today was a half day. I spent the morning in Jason Bickle’s session around pragmatic instructional design. In his DECLARE method, I saw a lot of what I’ve done previously with clients by asking them to help me plan out, in spreadsheet form, the content for the course and the correct medium, and the necessary assets. This was really more of a form of project and asset management for efficiency, and it was interesting to hear about how Jason has used his method to make development work work better.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 810px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"stages of conflict journey\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-aabb5.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-2320f.jpg 203w,\\n/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-427c1.jpg 405w,\\n/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-aabb5.jpg 810w,\\n/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-f0fe6.jpg 1215w,\\n/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-c6859.jpg 1620w,\\n/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-648e9.jpg 2430w,\\n/static/img_2241-c8d99bb4bb383fb57ca1c690fbe379ab-0e50d.jpg 4032w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n    <figcaption>8 stages of the conflict journey</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>Then in Katie Stroud’s session, she overlayed the hero’s journey to thinking about how do we design around the conflict journey for change management for a user. I think really insightful steps were thinking about:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>3 Resistance:</strong> Are we trying to deploy training before learners have reached the stage of conflict where they recognize that there is a problem to solve? If so, we may be causing conflict.</li>\\n<li><strong>6 Moving into the Unknown:</strong> What is going to get in the way of learners being able to implement the changes and how do we design around that?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>My last presenter session was from Joseph Suarez (!!!) where he told stories about his experience as an instructional designer and extrapolated some important lessons learned. I’ve read quite a lot around UX (user experience) and Joe shared a really impactful story around how observing his learners with training he designed really blew a whole in his thinking about how he advocated for design. While companies will often prioritize UX in other areas, I think they don’t expect it from us, but those tools and methodologies are essential for the work that we do, as well. As I’ve said before, I think there’s a TON we can learn from that discipline.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 810px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"gap between web development and elearning development\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-aabb5.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-2320f.jpg 203w,\\n/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-427c1.jpg 405w,\\n/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-aabb5.jpg 810w,\\n/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-f0fe6.jpg 1215w,\\n/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-c6859.jpg 1620w,\\n/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-648e9.jpg 2430w,\\n/static/img_2244-687afbcea5ea70b2bcaf3efe9a435367-0e50d.jpg 4032w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n    <figcaption>The strangeness of elearning courses comes from not bridging the gap.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<h2>My Experience</h2>\\n<p>On the whole, my experience with Learning Dev Camp has been pretty good. My first day or two were a bit spotty. I had a lot of questions (which is probably a good thing) but I wasn’t feeling inspired or excited or any of those things that other people say they feel when they come away from conferences. I still wouldn’t say I was either of those things, but I’ve heard a lot of good sessions and I’m coming away with a need to take some time to reflect on the way I work and my processes.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"June 15, 2018\",\"path\":\"/blog/weeknotes-learning-dev-camp-day-2-to-3\",\"title\":\"Weeknotes: Learning Dev Camp Day 2 to 3\",\"tags\":[\"conferences\",\"elearning\",\"learning dev camp\"],\"categories\":[\"Commonplace Book\",\"Weeknotes\"],\"featured\":{\"childImageSharp\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":1.7777777777777777,\"src\":\"/static/Learning-Dev-Camp-Day-2-and-3-0f92e8e9c4a9351beb8a231659ecd754-c9de9.png\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/Learning-Dev-Camp-Day-2-and-3-0f92e8e9c4a9351beb8a231659ecd754-aafd1.png 203w,\\n/static/Learning-Dev-Camp-Day-2-and-3-0f92e8e9c4a9351beb8a231659ecd754-c6a3b.png 405w,\\n/static/Learning-Dev-Camp-Day-2-and-3-0f92e8e9c4a9351beb8a231659ecd754-c9de9.png 560w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\"}}}}}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/blog-weeknotes-learning-dev-camp-day-2-to-3.json\n// module id = 485\n// module chunks = 210109762357374"],"sourceRoot":""}
