If you do any sort of client-facing training, whether that’s how to use the LMS or how to use the software or other product your organization has developed, think about the impact that a follow up email with a personalized job-aid could have. How might you create a reusable template that you could send out to new users? What questions or concerns can you address, right off the bat? Try creating a resource that provides an initial customer service experience for your organization, before folks have to email or get on the phone with you. This is a proactive approach that has anticipated a common problem (sticker shock, confusion over the first bill) and pre-empted it, providing a positive initial experience. In fact, I was just discussing this idea at work, where we are facing an issue of not having enough staff to meet demand for training around basic instructional design principles and our LMS. I suggested that we needed to create an initial resource for campus groups looking to learn more about both of these issues, to provide that first experience. For folks who are just looking for some basic facts and how-tos, the resource would give them exactly what they need, on demand. For others who have more questions, they could come in and see us. This approach is sustainable and scalable, helping us to meet the needs of the hundreds of faculty members we serve. In the light of this, I could also see us going that extra mile, particularly after a workshop or consultation, and sending a personalized job aid, tailored for that particular person’s course idea. Do any of you do anything like this currently? Have you received a really good piece of instructional design lately?</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"October 19, 2015\",\"path\":\"/blog/steal-this-idea-personalized-job-aids\",\"title\":\"Steal this Idea: Personalized Job Aids\",\"tags\":[\"job aid\",\"microlearning\",\"personalization\",\"video\"],\"categories\":[\"Design\",\"Inspiration\"],\"featured\":{\"childImageSharp\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAKCAYAAAC0VX7mAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAACt0lEQVQozx2Q20vTcRjGf0VGOZt4+v12njohN6fzsEwz04oEC4KiLgxCJOgiCKKr7DL6HyTosrxoatnJrZPpls1NnZZDncvzEUvNLcWEPn3ZxYfn5f0+vDzfR9qJ/YC9efi3yN7uHPGtKeLxGWJ/ZoltzxPfXiC+s8DO7hLbu4tiN5t4j8eEb+sHsd+TxDcniG+MCx1Dmp0awPXsCS0tLfi/vuePMG2tR4VxKqGbaxF+/4wwFR1kYTqU2Mc2BRvCszkpVLA+QezXuPCPI1VVX0HRVZKZVYbBXs+j+ovMFFkZth5l/EwN01cvMX+9gX5nGT3HyvnmsPPdbmXEbGDmYTNbfxfZWA2zsTaWQNLpKzCZKzAbnaQaK2k8pOeTtJ+BrAxCJSW8UQy4bQ7emS2MnK4lXOJgSCMzqFYTvX+XdVHF2tIoayvhBJLRdBydvhS91kGqwUlTWg4fjqQycfYU4ZpqOk0W2lLS6dQY8VccJ1J3lnBVBSPZJqIPmlmJzbA8N8zywkgCSasrQaMpQqvYUWmLuanW4du3n1cHDvEmWU2vyYxXlulOyyBozSdoyWXIkkPgYBLf79wkujpKdMzLZOQLEYGkaAqRlQIU2YZKKeSa2sDrg8m0p8u4MhSep2XSlZ1LZ6YGX54Fv91GyFnMkOhw8N5t/OJYoP8tgWAX/gEPkixbkeV8tFn5JIuUt1I0hCQJX1ISfYdVBPQGfCq1IIWgTs9wRjrBI2IWnr4bDXSPdtPj68Trf8WXwFukHK0ds0iYrREqvm4ViU/oi6nOO4ldW0qB3onTUkmRoZSL1fWE3rXS8+IxbtcjPO6nuL3Pcfd04Olt572YpWxxzCDSmRQbuaLDPGM5Nkst5fbzFNrqUKXn46i6wLnLjVxpuoV32MPL3g46PrfR/vEZLnHU1fU0oW2eVv4DfcbzUfOEee8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\",\"aspectRatio\":2,\"src\":\"/static/Steal-This-Idea-99bb948d3852c91cf96b0d92457ba6c9-81d39.png\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/Steal-This-Idea-99bb948d3852c91cf96b0d92457ba6c9-9a8d1.png 203w,\\n/static/Steal-This-Idea-99bb948d3852c91cf96b0d92457ba6c9-c53f9.png 405w,\\n/static/Steal-This-Idea-99bb948d3852c91cf96b0d92457ba6c9-81d39.png 810w,\\n/static/Steal-This-Idea-99bb948d3852c91cf96b0d92457ba6c9-fda19.png 1024w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\"}}}}}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---blog-steal-this-idea-personalized-job-aids-e5cedbfe60ca3f756cf7.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>When I moved for my new job, I decided to cut the cord and only purchase an internet connection.
