I also need to delve deeper into Atomic design and make sure that I am really understanding the concepts, but I do like the idea, in particular since, in my current environment, development work is not something that we do much of ourselves. I need to be able to teach others how to develop. I think patterns might be a great way of doing that. What do you think? What might be content and display patterns in online learning?</p>',frontmatter:{date:"February 23, 2016",path:"/blog/patterns-in-learning-experience-design",title:"Patterns in Learning Experience Design",tags:["elearning","modular design","online learning","web design"],categories:["Commonplace Book","Design","Showing my Work","What If Ideas"],featured:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAKCAYAAAC0VX7mAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAACUklEQVQozy1Q2VPSURT+TWVZk9WMNU1WPvTQ2EPTTI0jLS6I7IuACChBgpnFGC4oNeyCogj+AkQEFE0UtbFlmh76877uufbwzTn33PMt9wrFZC8aRSN2MkqcVq04KBh4f1wy8/prdxRfv2ixn9Ph75EHJ1tD+FN38TntEJc4P3bs2F5TQKDlalqOet7AiDo+/Fa2oLwygKNNE3bX1dgTtdyMziR6uGHkAo2iifH0nFNekXFTIR9/xQgaVFYHQGkPCnrQrMIW6LwnqvmMiN+3rUxsED9rdtSyStSZABmSuRh5DjH6AgI1RMwEO7G1LEUppUIlrUU5rUN1TYPGphWNkhXHZQcTG8JJ2YaTihO/6+PYL1i4cGVVhlzsJVILTyH4nHcQ+fgI+YQcsZlnSAU6Icak2FhSYDdnRzVrwWHJidPaBDMZZGczauIwcvF+VDODyEbZy5aVCHsf4tO7BxBmx+7C52xDcqEbS4EepD73Ih2SIzz1hPX93GQ9rmMzBbIxDcRFHTJRFSLTEsT9PVj0dyPsk8ClvwyH5iKEEFOmhKvBPiTnJRDjSuQSGqSDUiT9XQh6O7hJYp79UVyF9ZgKyUAf5sY7OKIzXQhMPsaIqgmj6qazJ4f+x512tWHKcRtz7vsM7Zgdu8fx3taKD/abvB83X8MbwxUOj/Eq3g5dh0UmMMELZwk9phZMWlvh97RzonfkFidRJZDhhOUGh5sJ0NOo0g7NKJVdeZ6JXYJNcQ4CXTh1zTwB9WRAQuRMaQl0R0RK4Da28B0Sfa1t5mLEp0r4B2K8tFHNqnoFAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC",aspectRatio:2,src:"/static/Instructional-Design-Patterns-c36d3af278dd7e3ba194d6d34c8773db-81d39.png",srcSet:"/static/Instructional-Design-Patterns-c36d3af278dd7e3ba194d6d34c8773db-9a8d1.png 203w,\n/static/Instructional-Design-Patterns-c36d3af278dd7e3ba194d6d34c8773db-c53f9.png 405w,\n/static/Instructional-Design-Patterns-c36d3af278dd7e3ba194d6d34c8773db-81d39.png 810w,\n/static/Instructional-Design-Patterns-c36d3af278dd7e3ba194d6d34c8773db-fda19.png 1024w",sizes:"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"}}}}}},pathContext:{}}}});
