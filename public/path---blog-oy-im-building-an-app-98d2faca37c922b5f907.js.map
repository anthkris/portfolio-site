Ionic has great documentation and even an <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-conference-app\\\">entire demo conference app</a>. But my first hurdle came when trying to replicate the tinder-like card animations. I found two separate plugins that would allow me to implement this, but I couldn’t figure out how to allow a person to go back a card through a swipe event. I tried really hard, but eventually, I decided that this UI wasn’t essential to the app and decided to pivot in favor of moving on instead of getting stuck. Ionic has a ton of great built-in components, and I restyled their slides to fit the bill. After that, development was once again, relatively easy, until I decided that I wanted to try and send xAPI statements from the app, which meant that I now needed users to log in. Instead of allowing people to create their own username and password, I’ve decided to use social login, so that people can log in to the app using Google and Twitter. That took me several hours to get working. Finally, I’m at the point where I’m trying to embed the appropriate code to send statement! After most of the weekend spent trying to get the YouTube Iframe API to work in the app and access the calls I wanted, I’m ready to start the part I’m not confident on: making well-formed xAPI statements! Here’s what I plan to track:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Initial log in</li>\\n<li>Start Lesson or Continue Lesson</li>\\n<li>Lesson progress</li>\\n<li>Question answered and answer chosen</li>\\n<li>Lesson completed (should only trigger once)</li>\\n<li><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Video watched, completed, etc. (<a href=\\\"https://registry.tincanapi.com/#profile/19/recipes\\\">https://registry.tincanapi.com/#profile/19/recipes</a>)</span></li>\\n<li>Link clicked</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>As others have said, the hard part with xAPI isn’t the sending of statements, it’s really the planning out of the data and I’m still really new to the spec and trying to make sure that I’m doing things right (which is where having a community in the cohort helps!). Last cohort meeting, Sean Putnam also offered up one great way to look at thinking about your data plan, tracking participation vs tracking performance. For this app, definitely participation-based metrics are what I’m after!</p>\\n<figure>\\n    \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 730px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 102.73972602739725%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"Trello board card\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/Screen-Shot-2017-09-11-at-6.31.04-PM-76d6421e0312552d3e5be6eed15d77e8-366d0.png\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/Screen-Shot-2017-09-11-at-6.31.04-PM-76d6421e0312552d3e5be6eed15d77e8-bf4d2.png 203w,\\n/static/Screen-Shot-2017-09-11-at-6.31.04-PM-76d6421e0312552d3e5be6eed15d77e8-68154.png 405w,\\n/static/Screen-Shot-2017-09-11-at-6.31.04-PM-76d6421e0312552d3e5be6eed15d77e8-366d0.png 730w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n    <figcaption>My expanding trello card for initial development</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<h3>Got Any Suggestions?</h3>\\n<p>I’m hoping to release the app by the end of the month (definitely by the end of the cohort).

(I haven’t shared any of the assets (they’re copyrighted) and I’ve also not shared my LRS set up as it contains the credentials). Also, if you want to checkout an alpha version of the app, and give me feedback, you can do so like this: You can view the app in its current form by downloading this app: <a href=\\\"https://view.ionic.io/\\\">https://view.ionic.io/</a> And searching for this: <strong>d3310808</strong> Ionic View is currently only available for iOS, though they do have a legacy version for Android (not sure how it works). Note that the app is a bit wiggly and can be turned landscape in this testing environment. Those things won’t be true when the app is in production. Would love to get any feedback on how to make it better from an ID perspective!</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"September 12, 2017\",\"path\":\"/blog/oy-im-building-an-app\",\"title\":\"Oy!

As I kept building, I tried to keep things small, but also made sure to add features that I felt would help the experience be better.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 810px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"app sketches\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/app_sketch-ba1a74f418af610e278c76cd3a76a0b3-aabb5.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/app_sketch-ba1a74f418af610e278c76cd3a76a0b3-2320f.jpg 203w,\\n/static/app_sketch-ba1a74f418af610e278c76cd3a76a0b3-427c1.jpg 405w,\\n/static/app_sketch-ba1a74f418af610e278c76cd3a76a0b3-aabb5.jpg 810w,\\n/static/app_sketch-ba1a74f418af610e278c76cd3a76a0b3-f0fe6.jpg 1215w,\\n/static/app_sketch-ba1a74f418af610e278c76cd3a76a0b3-c6859.jpg 1620w,\\n/static/app_sketch-ba1a74f418af610e278c76cd3a76a0b3-648e9.jpg 2430w,\\n/static/app_sketch-ba1a74f418af610e278c76cd3a76a0b3-025cb.jpg 3024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n    <figcaption>My initial sketches</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>Getting the app started was actually really easy! Ionic has great documentation and even an <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-conference-app\\\">entire demo conference app</a>. But my first hurdle came when trying to replicate the tinder-like card animations. I found two separate plugins that would allow me to implement this, but I couldn’t figure out how to allow a person to go back a card through a swipe event. I tried really hard, but eventually, I decided that this UI wasn’t essential to the app and decided to pivot in favor of moving on instead of getting stuck. Ionic has a ton of great built-in components, and I restyled their slides to fit the bill. After that, development was once again, relatively easy, until I decided that I wanted to try and send xAPI statements from the app, which meant that I now needed users to log in. Instead of allowing people to create their own username and password, I’ve decided to use social login, so that people can log in to the app using Google and Twitter. That took me several hours to get working. Finally, I’m at the point where I’m trying to embed the appropriate code to send statement! After most of the weekend spent trying to get the YouTube Iframe API to work in the app and access the calls I wanted, I’m ready to start the part I’m not confident on: making well-formed xAPI statements! Here’s what I plan to track:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Initial log in</li>\\n<li>Start Lesson or Continue Lesson</li>\\n<li>Lesson progress</li>\\n<li>Question answered and answer chosen</li>\\n<li>Lesson completed (should only trigger once)</li>\\n<li><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Video watched, completed, etc. (<a href=\\\"https://registry.tincanapi.com/#profile/19/recipes\\\">https://registry.tincanapi.com/#profile/19/recipes</a>)</span></li>\\n<li>Link clicked</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>As others have said, the hard part with xAPI isn’t the sending of statements, it’s really the planning out of the data and I’m still really new to the spec and trying to make sure that I’m doing things right (which is where having a community in the cohort helps!). Last cohort meeting, Sean Putnam also offered up one great way to look at thinking about your data plan, tracking participation vs tracking performance. For this app, definitely participation-based metrics are what I’m after!</p>\\n<figure>\\n    \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 730px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 102.73972602739725%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"Trello board card\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/Screen-Shot-2017-09-11-at-6.31.04-PM-76d6421e0312552d3e5be6eed15d77e8-366d0.png\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/Screen-Shot-2017-09-11-at-6.31.04-PM-76d6421e0312552d3e5be6eed15d77e8-bf4d2.png 203w,\\n/static/Screen-Shot-2017-09-11-at-6.31.04-PM-76d6421e0312552d3e5be6eed15d77e8-68154.png 405w,\\n/static/Screen-Shot-2017-09-11-at-6.31.04-PM-76d6421e0312552d3e5be6eed15d77e8-366d0.png 730w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n    <figcaption>My expanding trello card for initial development</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<h3>Got Any Suggestions?</h3>\\n<p>I’m hoping to release the app by the end of the month (definitely by the end of the cohort). Almost all the code is on Github here: <a href=\\\"https://github.com/UXLX/uxlx\\\">https://github.com/UXLX/uxlx</a>. (I haven’t shared any of the assets (they’re copyrighted) and I’ve also not shared my LRS set up as it contains the credentials). Also, if you want to checkout an alpha version of the app, and give me feedback, you can do so like this: You can view the app in its current form by downloading this app: <a href=\\\"https://view.ionic.io/\\\">https://view.ionic.io/</a> And searching for this: <strong>d3310808</strong> Ionic View is currently only available for iOS, though they do have a legacy version for Android (not sure how it works). Note that the app is a bit wiggly and can be turned landscape in this testing environment. Those things won’t be true when the app is in production. Would love to get any feedback on how to make it better from an ID perspective!</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"September 12, 2017\",\"path\":\"/blog/oy-im-building-an-app\",\"title\":\"Oy!
