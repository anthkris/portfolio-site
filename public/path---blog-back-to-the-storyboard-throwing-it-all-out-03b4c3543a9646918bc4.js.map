You might notice that the vid here shows the Arc de Triomphe. I always intended to change that. It’s no good showing a Parisian landmark in a London-themed course. But that wasn’t what was bothering me. One of the things I didn’t like was the dark theme I had going on here. Somehow I just couldn’t keep going with that. Bright and fresh seemed more appropriate, perhaps because I was basing my idea on AirBNB. Still, the main problem though was that I wasn’t 100 percent on the way the activities themselves should look and work. I had maps on the brain. I was thinking London underground map for the main them, and then a map of London boroughs would form the base for the initial interactions (you can see them in my original sketch). But the more I tried to make this work, the more it struck me as the wrong direction. I mean, who cares which borough the London eye is in. That isn’t really how most travelers navigate things. The important bit was focusing the interaction on finding the right attractions for the customers, not locating the attractions.</p>\\n<figure>\\n  <img src=\\\"/travellydemo-0278ab41099a079528225c8119d72def.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Travelly original functionality\\\">\\n</figure>\\n<h3>Redesign</h3>\\n<p>This weekend, I finally allowed myself to chuck everything out and start over.

I know that some people are okay jumping right into the development tool, but I’ve always found that to be a problem when I don’t have a clear vision. By removing my work to a more throw-away workspace like PowerPoint or paper, it’s easier for me to think big and let go. I definitely recommend it if you ever have trouble pinning down a good design.</p>\\n<figure>\\n  <img src=\\\"/travellydemo2-6d9cc9fd469dddb07a712aa5351295df.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Travelly second attempt functionality\\\">\\n</figure>\\n<h2>What Are You Designing?</h2>\\n<p>Any one else working on this month’s GDS Challenge?
