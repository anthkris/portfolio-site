I needed the computer to respond intelligently, and never lose. So I ended up looking up tic tac toe strategy to think more strategically about how to make the appropriate moves.

And that helped a ton! I highly recommend reading it if you’re stuck for ideas on how to make a smart computer player. Creating an end game, terminal state was probably my second biggest problem.
