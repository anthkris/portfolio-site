What does this mean for you? This season will be dedicated to breaking down real instructional design-type projects to get at what makes them work. I’ve got interviews coming up, centered around case study-type questions. I’ve also got a special series planned (wait for the real first episode release to learn more!) and, more to the point of this blog post, my solo episodes this season will center on project teardowns. The concept of the design teardown is the same as other kinds of analysis or reverse engineering: it’s breaking apart a whole into its parts to see what makes it tick. I was introduced to design teardowns on a site called <a href=\\\"http://www.useronboard.com/\\\">UserOnboard</a>, an amazing resource by the UX Designer Samuel Hulick. Hulick has been tearing down app onboarding experiences screen-by-screen for a couple of years. Given this season’s theme, this seemed like a good process to try. I’ll admit I’m a little worried that the audio-only, podcast version of these won’t work, but I’m trying it anyway.
